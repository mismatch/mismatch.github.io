	    <h1>About me</h1>
	    <p>I am an architect and developer with 15 years of experience in total. My main area of expertise is a maintenance and modernization of multi-tenant SaaS solutions for enterprises. I have an experience in total rewriting and step-by-step refactoring of such solutions. It is very important to keep software and processes around it in a shape. That's why I'm a big proponent of clean code and architecture, DevOps and DX (developer experience). Also I see value in mature technologies and tools that keep evolving. This is a good base for a long-living software. I keep learning new things as modernization happens when you use something modern (let me be your Captain Obvious).</p>
